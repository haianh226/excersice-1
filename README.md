This was a tough and challenging exercise for me as I spent a lot of time struggling to complete it. I had no prior knowledge of Git or GitHub, so at first, I was very confused about what I was doing. I didn’t realize that I needed to create a repository on GitHub first, which led to challenges right from the start. When I tried to create and commit the README.md file, my computer kept showing errors like "no README file" or "not a git repository," which took me hours to figure out.

Moreover, when I reached the next stage — creating a branch and merging — even though I successfully created a new branch, I couldn't add a file to it. I misunderstood the problem and spent another hour trying to figure it out. Eventually, I realized that my dev branch wasn't in the correct directory.

However, after completing the exercise, I gained knowledge on how to create a repository, commit changes, create a branch, add a file, and create a pull request. I can't say that I fully understand Git yet, but I’m committed to putting in more effort in the upcoming exercises. I hope that by the end of the course, I will be more proficient in using GitHub.
